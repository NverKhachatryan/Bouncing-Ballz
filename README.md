# Bouncing Ballz Simulator

## Description

The Bouncing Ballz Simulator is a simple web application demonstrating physics with HTML5 Canvas. Users can click on the canvas to create balls that bounce realistically with gravity and dampening effects.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Bouncing Ballz Simulator:

1. **Clone/Download the Repository**
   - `git clone https://github.com/NverKhachatryan/bouncing-ballz.git`
   - -or- Download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Open the Application**
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the files.
   - Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
   - Write  `tsc bouncing-ballz.ts` in CLI

3. **Interact with the Simulator**
   - Click anywhere on the canvas to create a new ball.
   - Watch the ball fall under gravity, bounce, and eventually come to rest.
   - Create multiple balls by clicking on different areas of the canvas. (Up to 15 balls are supported simultaneously for performance reasons.)

4. **Enjoy the Physics**
   - Balls will interact with the 'floor' at the bottom of the canvas.
   - Each bounce dampens until the ball comes to a complete stop.
